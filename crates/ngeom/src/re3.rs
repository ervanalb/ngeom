//! Rigid Euclidean 3D geometry
//!
//! This module contains primitives for doing rigid geometry in 3D Euclidean space.
//!
//! It is *rigid* because its primitives can express transformations that preserve length--
//! such as translations, rotations, and reflections.
//! It cannot inherently represent non-rigid transformations, such as dilation or shear--
//! you will have to eject into a matrix representation (or similar) if you want to do those.
//!
//! It is *3D* because there are three spatial dimensions.
//! A fourth projective dimension is added, resulting in homogeneous coordinates.
//!
//! It is *Euclidean* because the space has zero curvature,
//! i.e. the parallel postulate holds.

    /// ## As geometry
    /// Geometrically, a `Vector` can be either:
    /// * A point in space, e.g. `Vector {x, y, z, w: 1}`, which represents a location.
    ///   See the [`Vector::point([x, y, z])`](crate::ops::Point)
    ///   or [`Vector::origin()`](crate::ops::Origin) constructors.
    /// * An ideal point, or point at infinity, e.g. `Vector {x, y, z, w: 0}`, which representing a direction.
    ///   See the [`Vector::ideal_point([x, y, z])`](crate::ops::IdealPoint),
    ///   [`Vector::x_hat()`](crate::ops::XHat),
    ///   [`Vector::y_hat()`](crate::ops::YHat), or
    ///   [`Vector::z_hat()`](crate::ops::ZHat) constructors.

    /// * Two points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a [line](Bivector) containing both.
    /// * Two unitized points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a line whose [weight norm](crate::ops::WeightNorm) is the distance between them.
    /// * Three unitized points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a [plane](Trivector).
    /// * Four unitized points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a parallelepiped's [signed volume](AntiScalar).
    /// * The sum of two unitized points is their midpoint.
    /// * [Unitizing](crate::ops::Unitized) a point divides by the projective coordinate
    ///   to make w=1 without changing its location
    /// * [Normalizing](crate::ops::Normalized) an ideal point divides by its length
    ///   to make a unit vector.
    /// * The [motor between](crate::ops::MotorTo) two unitized points produces a translation
    ///   by twice their separation
