//! Rigid Euclidean 2D geometry
//!
//! This module contains primitives for doing rigid geometry in 2D Euclidean space.
//!
//! It is *rigid* because its primitives can express transformations that preserve length--
//! such as translations, rotations, and reflections.
//! It cannot inherently represent non-rigid transformations, such as dilation or shear--
//! you will have to eject into a matrix representation (or similar) if you want to do those.
//!
//! It is *2D* because there are two spatial dimensions.
//! A third projective dimension is added, resulting in homogeneous coordinates.
//!
//! It is *Euclidean* because the space has zero curvature,
//! i.e. the parallel postulate holds.

    /// ## As geometry
    /// Geometrically, a `Vector` can be either:
    /// * A point in space, e.g. `Vector {x, y, w: 1}`, which represents a location.
    ///   See the [`Vector::point([x, y])`](crate::ops::Point)
    ///   or [`Vector::origin()`](crate::ops::Origin) constructors.
    /// * An ideal point, or point at infinity, e.g. `Vector {x, y, w: 0}`, which representing a direction.
    ///   See the [`Vector::ideal_point([x, y])`](crate::ops::IdealPoint),
    ///   [`Vector::x_hat()`](crate::ops::XHat), or
    ///   [`Vector::y_hat()`](crate::ops::YHat) constructors.
    ///
    /// All `Vector`s represent some kind of point.
    ///
    /// ## As a transformation
    /// When interpreted as a transformation, a point performs an inversion--
    /// equivalent to a 180-degree rotation about itself.
    ///
    /// ## Example Operations
    /// * Two points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a [line](Bivector) containing both.
    /// * Two unitized points [join](crate::ops::Join) into a line whose [weight norm](crate::ops::WeightNorm) is the distance between them.
    /// * Three unitized points [join](crate::ops::Join) into their parallelogram's [signed area](AntiScalar).
    /// * The sum of two unitized points is their midpoint.
    /// * [Unitizing](crate::ops::Unitized) a point divides by the projective coordinate
    ///   to make w=1 without changing its location
    /// * [Normalizing](crate::ops::Normalized) an ideal point divides by its length
    ///   to make a unit vector.
    /// * The [motor between](crate::ops::MotorTo) two unitized points produces a translation
    ///   by twice their separation
